# NeuralNet_Basic

I'm busy changing this at the moment and will replace this repository with an updated one called ANN when the work is complete: Don't bother with this at the moment, update should be within a few weeks (13 May 2020).

Implementing a basic neural network in Unity. This is the outcome of some miss-spent time on a personal exploration of how neural networks worked. This sample allows a small network to predict the values of a sine function, but could be trivially re-purposed to many other simple tasks. Check out the wiki for more information.

## Things to know
It is basic (no inertia in weights and no control of variance in intial weight selection for example).

It is not fast.

It is not integrated into CUDA or even Unity job control.

It has not been developed with a view to bigger things - perhaps you could make convolutional networks with it, but I've not tried.
